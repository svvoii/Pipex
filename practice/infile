Requirements
Your project must comply with the following rules:
• You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not
relink.
• You have to handle errors thoroughly. In no way your program should quit unex-
pectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, and so forth).
• Your program mustn’t have memory leaks.
• If you have any doubt, handle the errors like the shell command:
< file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2
